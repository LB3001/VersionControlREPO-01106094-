Idea for Game: 
2D Platformer where the 'character' morphs into different objects (Boat, Car. Helicopter etc) to navigate obstacles.
(Game would most likely be of the Time Waster Type). 


Reference Characters: Ditto (Pokemon) and Jake (Adventure Time)


Audio Ideas:
- The jumping could be similar to Mario jumping sound

Potential Design Ideas:
- Monochrome Theme
